## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Structures Python repository, where you'll find a comprehensive collection of common data structures implemented in the Python language, including Queue, Stack, and Union Find. The repository is designed to be useful for both beginners and experienced developers, providing well-documented, efficient implementations of the data structures along with examples and usage instructions to help you get started.

## Implemented Data Structures

### Queue

-   Monotonic Queue: This is a queue that maintains the monotonicity of its elements.

### Stack

-   Monotonic Stack: This is a stack that maintains the monotonicity of its elements.

### Trie

-   A Trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a collection of strings. It is also known as a prefix tree.

### Union Find

-   Union-find data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.

## Usage

Simply import the desired data structure from the respective module. The functions are well-documented and easy to understand.

## Contribution

We appreciate any contributions to this repository. If you have an idea for a new data structure or want to improve an existing one, please submit a pull request. We ask that you follow the code style and formatting used in the existing code, and provide detailed documentation for any new or modified data structures. Thank you for your support!
